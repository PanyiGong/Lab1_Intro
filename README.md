## The challenge during my process was trying to figure out the coordinates of every shape I'm trying to draw. It requires a lot of math. I learned how to draw half shape using the arc function and parallelograms using the quad function. I'm proud that I'm able to create a complex shape using the basic codes of circle, eclipse, rectangle, square, quad, dots, and strokes.
